cut is a very simple utility that can help your perform different kinds of tasks.

For example:
You can break a file into lines and process each line individually.

file, err := os.Open("file.go")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
c := cut.New()
os.Copy(c, file)

for line := range c.Between("", "\n") {
	fmt.Println(line)
}
